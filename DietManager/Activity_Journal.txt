Part 1 – Product & Unit Test Classes – Start
Estimated Time	H3 MM
Plan for this level:
Read the comments for each function to harvest an understanding of what I need to do.

Part 1 – Product & Unit Test Classes – Completed
Actual Time	H5 MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
Had a lot of issues with the log with the date formats - - - vs / / / and keeping track of that.Was eventually able to complete.

Part 2 – DietManager Levels – Completed
Actual Time	H5 MM
Lessons learned, problems encountered, obstacles overcome, etc.
Had issues with storing the items (log) because it would rewrite the entire text file in the wrong format and then break the program. Was able to debug. Also had issues with overall formatting in some cases for the display.

Project reflection: Thought this was good practice of Ruby OO
